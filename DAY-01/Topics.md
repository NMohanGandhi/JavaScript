#1 Variables, DataTypes, Operators

1.Create a variable myNum and assign it a value of 10. Add 5 to myNum and store the result in a new variable called newNum.

2.Declare a variable called myString and assign it a string value of your choice. Use the length property to find the length of the string.

3.Create an array called myArray with three elements of different data types. Access the second element in the array and store it in a new variable called secondElement.

4.Declare a variable called myBool and assign it a boolean value of true. Use the typeof operator to verify that myBool is a boolean.

5.Create a function called sumOfSquares that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the sum of their squares. For example, sumOfSquares(3, 4) should return 25 (which is 3 squared plus 4 squared).

6.Declare a variable called myObject and assign it an object literal with three key-value pairs. Use dot notation to access the value of one of the keys.

7.Write a function called convertToFahrenheit that takes a temperature in Celsius as a parameter and returns the temperature in Fahrenheit. The formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is (C * 9/5) + 32.

8.Declare a variable called myNull and assign it a value of null. Use the typeof operator to verify that myNull is a null value.

9.Write a function called reverseString that takes a string as a parameter and returns the string in reverse order. For example, reverseString("hello") should return "olleh".

10.Declare two variables, myUndefined and myNotDefined. Use the typeof operator to verify that myUndefined is undefined and myNotDefined is not defined.
