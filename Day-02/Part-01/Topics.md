#2 Conditional Statements - 1

1.Write a function called isEven that takes a number as a parameter and returns true if the number is even, and false otherwise.

2.Create a variable myNum and assign it a number value of your choice. Write a conditional statement that checks if myNum is greater than 10. If it is, log "myNum is greater than 10" to the console. If it's not, log "myNum is less than or equal to 10" to the console.

3.Write a function called isLeapYear that takes a year as a parameter and returns true if the year is a leap year, and false otherwise. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, but not by 100, or a year that is divisible by 400.

4.Create an array called myArray with five elements of different data types. Write a conditional statement that checks if the third element in the array is a string. If it is, log "The third element is a string" to the console. If it's not, log "The third element is not a string" to the console.

5.Write a function called isPositive that takes a number as a parameter and returns "positive" if the number is greater than 0, "negative" if the number is less than 0, and "zero" if the number is 0.

6.Create a variable called myBool and assign it a boolean value of your choice. Write a conditional statement that checks if myBool is true. If it is, log "myBool is true" to the console. If it's not, log "myBool is false" to the console.

7.Write a function called isTriangle that takes three numbers as parameters representing the sides of a triangle, and returns true if the sides can form a valid triangle, and false otherwise. A valid triangle has the property that the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.
