#2 Conditional Statements - 2

1.Write a function called isVowel that takes a character as a parameter and returns true if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), and false otherwise.

2.Create a variable myArray and assign it an array of numbers of your choice. Write a conditional statement that checks if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is greater than 10. If it is, log "The sum of the first and last elements is greater than 10" to the console. If it's not, log "The sum of the first and last elements is less than or equal to 10" to the console.

3.Write a function called isPalindrome that takes a string as a parameter and returns true if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and false otherwise.

4.Create an object called myObject with two key-value pairs representing a person's first name and last name. Write a conditional statement that checks if the length of the person's first name is greater than the length of their last name. If it is, log "The first name is longer than the last name" to the console. If it's not, log "The last name is longer than or equal to the first name" to the console.

5.Write a function called isPrime that takes a number as a parameter and returns true if the number is prime (only divisible by 1 and itself), and false otherwise.

6.Create a variable myString and assign it a string value of your choice. Write a conditional statement that checks if the string contains the substring "JavaScript". If it does, log "The string contains 'JavaScript'" to the console. If it doesn't, log "The string does not contain 'JavaScript'" to the console.
